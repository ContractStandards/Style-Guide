## Contract Building Blocks

Contracts are formal documents, generally constructed from three basic forms of sentences, each following the form of subject...verb...object.

* Obligations = Noun Entity (party)...modal verb...verb...object.
* Statements = Noun Generic...modal verb...verb...object.
* Definitions = Term...("means" / "includes")...definition

Conditions, qualifiers, and exceptions may appear in any order either preceding or following the obligation or statement:

[condition / predicate]...[obligation / statement]...object...[qualifier / exception].
