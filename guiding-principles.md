# [Style Guide](index.md) / Guiding Principles

## General
The ContractStandards Style Guide takes a modular, hierarchical approach to contract drafting, starting with the overall organization, delving deeper into sentences and words.

1. **Organization**: Follow a consistent, logical organizational structure
2. **Headings**: Use informative headings that serve as a summary of the contents
3. **Clauses**: Break text into smaller units with one substantive topic per clause
4. **Sentences**: Draft in short, declarative sentences
5. **Words**: Use standard language, without jargon or legalese
6. **Punctuation**: Use punctuation to aid readability

## Organization

Apply a consistent structure: Contract Standards Framework for Exchange Agreements

1. **The Bargain**. What are the parties buying or exchanging? Services, products, a license, property, etc?
2. **The Exchange**. What are the mechanics of exchange? How will the parties give and receive value?
3. **Term**. What is the time period of the agreement? When does it start? When does it end? Can the agreement be extended?
4. **Reps, Warranties and Acknowledgements**. What statements, facts and actions are material to the bargain?
5. **Conditions**. What actions, facts or circumstances must occur for the parties to close the transaction?
6. **Obligations**. What actions or forbearances must each party continue to perform during the term of the agreement?
7. **Rights**. What actions can the parties take to protect their interest in the bargain? Rights to terminate, adjust services or costs, etc.
8. **Remedies**. What can the parties do in the event the other does not perform its obligations?
9. **General Provisions**. How are disputes resolved? What laws apply? Who is benefited and bound by the agreement? How is the contract interpreted?

## Clauses

Clauses consolidate all elements of a single concept

1. **Subject matter**: Only one substantive concept per clause aids the reader's understanding. Do not draft compound clauses, such as: "Entire Agreement; Amendment; Waiver."

2. **Captions**: Use informative headings that serve as a summary of the contents
    * All clauses should have a caption
    * Captions should be descriptive and general
    * Use the same caption for similar clauses in other documents
    * Each caption should be unique in the agreement. Do not duplicate captions:
      * Sub-clauses should not have the same heading at their top-level heading
      * Make headings more descriptive rather repeating them: Vendor's Indemnity and Purchaser's Indemnity, rather than two different clauses both entitled Indemnity
    * Use "General" only as the heading for the final article that includes the various "boilerplate" clauses
    * No "stop words" such as "the," "a," "an," etc.
    * Include period at end of heading only if in-line
3. **Sections**
    * Lower-case "s" for sections: section 3.1 (Payment)
    * Add the section title in parentheses after a cross-reference: referred to in section 8.1 (Term)
    * Use "section" for all subdivisions, such as subsections, paragraphs, subparagraphs, etc.: referred to in section 3.1(a) (Payment - Overdue Interest)
    * Use "sections" when two or more are referred to: section 3.1 (Payment) and 3.1 (Reimbursement)
4. **White space**
    * Use white space to clarify meaning, particularly with lists
    * Break long clauses with multiple clauses into their own, separate clauses

## Sentences

Sentences capture a single thought.

1. **SVO: Draft in short, declarative sentences, using the form subject—verb—object.
2. Subject: Clearly indicate the subject of the sentence. Avoid indeterminate subjects, such as, "There are no representations, covenants, or other terms other than those set forth in this agreement".
3. Modifiers: Clearly mark conditions, qualifications, and exceptions.
4. Conditions: a prerequisite to an obligation or statement. For example: "If...."
5. Qualification: a modification, limitation, or restriction to an obligation or statement.
6. Exception: a situation excluded from the general rule.

Unless clarity suggests otherwise, the preferred sequence of sentence elements is [condition], [obligation or statement], [qualification or exception].

## Words

Words are the essential building blocks

1. Standard English: Use standard English, without jargon or legalese
      * Choose the simpler, commonly used word: provide rather than furnish
2. Duplicate Words: Eliminate duplicative words: sell rather than sell, transfer, and assign
3. Unnecessary Words: Eliminate all unnecessary words
      * Use "any" rather than "any and all"
      * Use "The Employer may..." rather than "The Employer may, for any reason whatsoever,..."
      * Decide if you need a descriptive list introduced by "including" - if you do, include only essential terms
4. Numbers and Dates
      * Spell out numbers up to nine but use numerals for 10 and above
      * Use percentage symbol: 80%
      * Use words for figures of one million and greater
      * No short-form date formats: December 31, 1999 and not 31/12/1999
5. "This agreement"
      * Refer to "this agreement" rather than "this Agreement"
      * There is no need to define "this agreement."
6. "shall," "must," and "will"
      * Use "shall" to mean [a party] has a duty to, such as "The Purchaser shall pay interest"
      * Except for shorter consumer agreements, avoid "must"; use "shall" instead
      * Use "will" to indicate futurity: This agreement will automatically renew...
7. "reasonable efforts"
      * Use only "reasonable efforts" and not any variation ("commercially reasonable efforts", etc.)
      * If aiming at a higher standard, do not use "best efforts" but define the standard
8. Problematic words
      * Exercise care when using terms such as "affect" and "effect", "alternate" and "alternative", "assume" and "presume", "between" and "among", "further" and "farther", "fewer" and "less", and "principle" and "principal"
      
## Punctuation and Grammar

Use proper punctuation and grammar to aid readability

1. Commas, semicolons, and periods
      * Use the serial comma for phrases using "and" or "or": A, B, and C or A, B, or C
      * Use the semicolon only as an alternative to a period; it is not as an alternative to a comma
      * Avoid periods in abbreviations: US rather than U.S.
2. Quotations and apostrophes
      * Use "traditional" rather than "logical" punctuation: quotations follow commas and periods, although they precede colons and semicolons
      * Do not use apostrophes to indicate plurals: MDs, not MD's
3. Grammar
      * Proper use of "that" and "which": "which" introduces a subordinate clause that is set off from the rest of the sentence by commas at the beginning and end
      
## Special cases

1. Avoid Latin terms: Use "for example" rather than "e.g." and "in other words" instead of "i.e."
2. Avoid "and/or": The phrase "A and/or B" may mean A or B, A and B, or A or B or both. Use the intended meaning.
3. Do not underline: use either bold or italics for emphasis.
4. Do not use full caps: NEVER USE THIS IN AN AGREEMENT.
5. Use contractions to aid understanding: "the Company's assets" rather than "the assets of the Company."
